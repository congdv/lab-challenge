# Labs Challenge

The website will read all the locations of the labs from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XjqJ7kp2AcMQjWaf_exDTTx-1qU4ctGp/view?usp=sharing).

From the locations, the site will use the map to display all locations. It allows user can search all lab by name

It was built with Express, React, and Webpack.

## Notes

Please create your own environment that following .env.sample.
